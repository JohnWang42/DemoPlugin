# Demo WP Plugin #

Example WordPress plugin for Inpsyde, by Johnny Wang

#### CSS and JS Prep ####

Included is a gulpfile I typically use on projects to automate compilation of my SCSS. It also minifies the CSS and JS automatically. Simply run `gulp` in root of the project to watch for new changes and update the files.
